<h2>One hot encoding is a technique used to convert categorical data into a numerical format that can be used by machine learning algorithms. This process is essential because many machine learning models require numerical input and cannot directly handle categorical data.

Definition and Purpose

One hot encoding transforms categorical variables into a series of binary columns, each representing a unique category. For example, if you have a categorical variable "Color" with values "Red," "Green," and "Blue," one hot encoding will create three new columns: "Color_Red," "Color_Green," and "Color_Blue." Each row will have a value of 1 in the column corresponding to its category and 0 in the other columns.</h2>
