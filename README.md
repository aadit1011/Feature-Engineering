All my Feature Engineering Practices

<p>Feature engineering is a preprocessing step in supervised machine learning and statistical modeling that transforms raw data into a more effective set of inputs. Each input comprises several attributes, known as features. By providing models with relevant information, feature engineering significantly enhances their predictive accuracy and decision-making capability.</p>
